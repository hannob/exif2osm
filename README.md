Convert JPEG exif geotags to link on openstreetmap.org

This is a small script that will read the GPS Longitude/Latitude tags from the EXIF data of a JPEG file
and will convert them into links on openstreetmap.org.

Many modern phones automatically add GPS tags, so this often gives you an easy way to find out where a picture was taken.
